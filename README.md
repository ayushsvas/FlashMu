# FLASHÂµ: Fast Localizing And Sizing of Holographic Microparticles

## Setup 
1. **Clone the repository**:

   git clone https://github.com/ayushsvas/flashmu.git
   cd FlashMu
   ```

2. **Micromambda Installation [OPTIONAL]**
   ```bash

For training and inference, we maintain a configuration file (config.py). train.py and infer.py scripts require path through config.py to training and test data, respectively. For your own data, make sure to type in the path to the folders containing them. 

## Training 
```bash
  python3 train.py
```

## Inference 
```bash
  python3 infer.py
```
